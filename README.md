Description:
This project was inpsired by my API assignment. I used the Advice Slip JSON API to search for quotes using a keyword (or "query"). For example, one of the values that exist for the "query" key is sun. When the user searches the word sun, they receive a quote of "The sun always shines above the clouds."
